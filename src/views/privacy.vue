  <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
  <h5>What are Cookies?</h5>
  <p>We collect information about your use of our Site through cookies. Cookies are information that files stored on your computer, tablet or smartphone that help websites remember who you are and information about your visit. Cookies can help to display the information on our Site in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies.</p>
  <h5>a. What cookies are used on this Site?</h5>
  <p>The cookies we and our business partners use on our Site are broadly grouped into the following categories:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Essential - </strong>Some of the cookies on our Site are essential for us to be able to provide you with a service you have requested. An example of this could be a cookie used to enable you to log into your account on our Site or which allows communication between your browser and our Site. Our cookie preference cookie described in the section “How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?” is also an essential cookie. You may not be able to use our Site without these cookies. </li>
    <li><strong>Analytics - </strong>We use analytics cookies to helps us understand how users engage with our Site. An example is counting the number of different people coming to our Site or using a particular feature, rather than the total number of times the site or feature is used. Without this cookie, if you visited our Site once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We would find it difficult to analyse how well our Site was performing and improve it without these cookies.</li>
    <li><strong>User Cookies –</strong>We use cookies to improve your experience by remembering your preferences so we know how you like to use our Site. Examples of this would be remembering you so that you are served with the same content or to remember you when you come back to our Site. </li>
    <li><strong>Social Sharing – </strong>We use third party cookies to allow you to share content directly on the social networking/sharing sites like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about us or our products or services. Please see our “Third Party Cookies” section below for more details. </li>
    <li><strong>Interest-Based Advertising –</strong>You will have noticed that when you visit websites you will be shown adverts for products and services you may wish to buy. The money made by website owners for showing third party adverts on their websites often pays for the cost of running the website and therefore usually allows you to use the website without having to pay a registration or usage fee. To try and ensure that the adverts you see are relevant to you third party cookies may be used to collect information about the types of things that interest you, for example websites you visit and the geography that you are based in. Having these cookies does not increase the number of adverts you will be shown, but simply makes the adverts you see more relevant. Please see our “Third Party Cookies” section below for more details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>b. How can I reject or opt out of receiving cookies?</h5>
  <p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you use our Site. The “Help” menu of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

  <h5>c. Third party cookies</h5>
  <p>Some of the cookies described in the "What Cookies are used on our Site" section above are stored on your machine by third parties when you use our Site. Third parties may also read cookies on your browser to collect information or to serve content or advertisements to you. We have no control over these cookies or how the third parties use them. They are used to allow that third party to provide a service to us, for example analytics. For more information on these cookies and how to disable them, please see:</p>

</section>

<section class="container my-5">
  <h2>5. Legal grounds for processing</h2>
  <p>Data protection law requires us to only process your personal data if we satisfy one or more legal grounds. These are set out in data protection law and we rely on a number of different grounds for the processing we carry out. These are as follows:</p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
  <p>In certain circumstances, we process your personal data after obtaining your consent to do so for the purposes of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>sending you marketing communications about our products and services;</li>
    <li>sharing your name, email address, postal address and telephone number with our trusted business partners so that they may market to you about their own similar products and services;</li>
    <li>conducting marketing research;</li>
    <li>obtaining your credit score so that we can establish the best possible payment terms we are able to offer to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Necessary for the performance of a contract and to comply with our legal obligations</strong>
  <p>It is necessary for us to process your basic contact details, payment details and information about the business you represent for the performance of the Trading Terms or Terms of Trading between us. In particular, we rely on this legal ground to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>provide you with the products and services;</li>
    <li>communicate with you about the products and services that we provide to you, including to let you know about major changes to those products and services or to the Trading Terms or Terms of Trading between us or to any related information;</li>
    <li>provide and improve customer support; and</li>
    <li>notify you about changes to our service</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you choose not to give some or all of the aforementioned information to us, this may affect our ability to provide our products and services to you.

In certain circumstances, we also use your personal data only to the extent required in order to enable us to comply with our legal obligations, including to detect, investigate and prevent fraud.</p>

<strong>Necessary for the purposes of our legitimate business interests or those of a third party</strong>
<p>It is sometimes necessary to collect and use your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests as a business, which are to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>provide you with products and services that are as useful and beneficial as possible, including by personalising our contact with you and making sure we tell you about all the offers that are relevant to you;</li>
  <li>better understand our customer base so that we can improve our products and services and marketing activities (which could also benefit you);</li>
  <li>comply with our contractual obligations to third parties;</li>
  <li>develop and improve our Site to enhance the customer experience;</li>
  <li>train our staff so that we can provide you with a better customer service;</li>
  <li>respond to any enquiries or complaints you have made, or deal with any dispute which may arise in the course of us providing our products and services to you; and</li>
  <li>to ensure that content from our Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;</li>
  <li>ensure effective operational management and internal administration of our business, document retention, compliance with regulatory guidance and exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where we think there is a risk that one of your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms may be affected we will not process your personal data unless there is another legal ground for us to do so (either that we have obtained your consent to the processing or it is necessary for us to perform our contract with you or to comply with our legal obligations).</p>
</section>
<section class="container my-5">
  <h2>6. Who we share your personal data with</h2>
  <p>We may provide your personal data to our suppliers and service providers, including other companies in our group, who provide certain business services for us and act as “processors” of your personal data on our behalf. In addition, we may disclose your personal data if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to protect the rights, property, or safety, of our business, our customers or others. This includes, in specific cases, exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.</p>
  <p>In some cases, the personal data we collect from you may, for the purposes set out above, be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and such destinations may not have laws which protect your personal data to the same extent as in the EEA. We are required by data protection law to ensure that where we or our “processors” transfer your personal data outside of the EEA, it is treated securely and is protected against unauthorised access, loss or destruction, unlawful processing and any processing which is inconsistent with the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
</section>
<section class="container my-5">
  <h2>7. How long we keep your personal data for </h2>
  <p>We retain your personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes(s) for which it was provided. What this means in practice will vary between different types of data. When determining the relevant retention periods, we take into account factors including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</li>
    <li>statute of limitations under applicable law;</li>
    <li>potential or actual disputes; and</li>
    <li>guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.</li>
  </ul>
